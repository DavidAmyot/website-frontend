# Introduction
This repository contains the source code for my website. It is a public, MIT licensed personal project which I am working on in my free time. The reason it exists is simply because I love programming and I always want to hone my skills whenever possible. Knowing how technology is ever-changing, this website was made with the recent Next.js React framework. My goal with this website is to stay up to date with the most recent technologies, keep my skills sharp and acquire new skills along the way. Everything will be made from scratch from conception to realization.

# Upcoming Integrations
- [ ] Convert app to TypeScript
- [ ] Add Node.js express API
- [ ] Add Docker Compose for website & API with multi-stage dockerfiles
